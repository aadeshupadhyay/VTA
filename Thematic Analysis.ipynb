      "**1. Forensic Cleaning:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Meaning:** This refers to the meticulous process of removing all traces of digital evidence from a computer system or storage device. It's done with the goal of making it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to recover any previously stored data.\n",
      "* **Context:**  Forensic cleaning is often used in situations where:\n",
      "    * A suspect wants to hide their digital activity.\n",
      "    * An organization needs to securely dispose of sensitive data before selling or donating a device.\n",
      "    * Law enforcement agencies need to ensure that evidence isn't inadvertently altered during an investigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Note:** Forensic cleaning is a complex process and should only be performed by trained professionals. Improperly executed cleaning can leave behind fragments of data, potentially compromising investigations or legal proceedings.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Defragmentation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Meaning:** This is the process of reorganizing files and data on a hard disk drive (HDD) to improve read/write performance. Over time, files are often scattered across different sectors of the drive, leading to fragmentation. Defragmentation groups these files together, making it faster for the computer to access them.\n",
      "* **Context:**  Defragmentation is primarily beneficial for HDDs, as SSDs (Solid State Drives) don't suffer from fragmentation in the same way.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Disk Cleanup:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Meaning:** This is a utility built into many operating systems (like Windows) that helps remove temporary files, system logs, and other unnecessary data from your hard drive.\n",
      "* **Context:**  Disk cleanup can free up valuable storage space and improve system performance. However, it's important to note that disk cleanup doesn't permanently delete all data; some files may still be recoverable with specialized tools.\n",
